This branch contains datasets from https://sites.google.com/site/hyperspectralcolorimaging/dataset
Our dataset repository consists of various indoor and outdoor scenes taken with a SPECIM hyperspectral camera and multiple consumer cameras. For consumer cameras, camera-specific RAW format that is free of any manipulation, is available. For easier classification, our hyperspectral camera dataset has been categorised into the following categories:
      General Scenes (Outdoor & Indoor)
      Fruits
      Color Charts and Patches
